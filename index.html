<h1>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<ol>
<li>Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
format relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.</li>
<li>Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' (docs.moodle.org/en/admin/setting/maintenancemode) so that there are no
users using it bar you as the administrator - if you have not already done so.</li>
<li>Copy 'grid' to '/course/format/' if you have not already done so.</li>
<li>Go back in as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to
'Site administration' -&gt; 'Notifications' if this does not happen.</li>
<li>Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.</li>
<li>You may need to check that the permissions within the 'grid' folder are 755 for folders and 644 for files.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="uninstallation" class="anchor" href="#uninstallation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uninstallation</h1>

<ol>
<li>Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.</li>
<li>It is recommended but not essential to change all of the courses that use the format to another.  If this is
not done Moodle will pick the last format in your list of formats to use but display in 'Edit settings' of the
course the first format in the list.  You can then set the desired format.</li>
<li>In '/course/format/' remove the folder 'grid'.</li>
<li>In the database, remove the row with the 'plugin' of 'format_grid' and 'name' of 'version' in the 'config_plugins' table
and drop the 'format_grid_icon' and 'format_grid_summary' tables.</li>
<li>Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="upgrade-instructions" class="anchor" href="#upgrade-instructions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upgrade Instructions</h1>

<ol>
<li>Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  This is essential as the
format relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.</li>
<li>Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.</li>
<li>In '/course/format/' move old 'grid' directory to a backup folder outside of Moodle.</li>
<li>Copy new 'grid' to '/course/format/'.</li>
<li>Go back in as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to
'Site administration' -&gt; 'Notifications' if this does not happen.</li>
<li>If you have upgraded from Moodle 1.9 and were using the Grid format there, please follow 'Upgrading from M1.9' below
and then return back here.</li>
<li>If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'
under 'Home -&gt; Site administration -&gt; Development -&gt; Purge all caches'.</li>
<li>Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="upgrading-from-m19" class="anchor" href="#upgrading-from-m19" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upgrading from M1.9</h1>

<p>When upgrading from Moodle 1.9 the grid icon images are moved to a 'legacy' files area.  So they will not show up when you
view the course as the format can no longer find them.  Therefore AFTER upgrading to Moodle 2.2+ please run the script
'convert_legacy_image.php' as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure you have updated fully to Moodle 2.2+.</li>
<li>Ensure you have updated properly to the Moodle 2.2+ version of the Grid format by clicking on 'Notifications' if you had
not replaced the folder before performing the Moodle 2.2+ upgrade.</li>
<li>Change the URL to have from the root of your Moodle installation: /course/format/grid/upgrade/convert_legacy_image.php -
i.e: <a href="http://www.mysite.com/moodle/course/format/grid/upgrade/convert_legacy_image.php">http://www.mysite.com/moodle/course/format/grid/upgrade/convert_legacy_image.php</a>
If you wish to crop instead of scaling the images then append '?crop=1' to the end of the URL like so:
<a href="http://www.mysite.com/moodle/course/format/grid/upgrade/convert_legacy_image.php?crop=1">http://www.mysite.com/moodle/course/format/grid/upgrade/convert_legacy_image.php?crop=1</a>
If you wish to get the full log output then append '?logverbose=1' to the end of the URL like so:
<a href="http://www.mysite.com/moodle/course/format/grid/upgrade/convert_legacy_image.php?logverbose=1">http://www.mysite.com/moodle/course/format/grid/upgrade/convert_legacy_image.php?logverbose=1</a>
or with crop:
<a href="http://www.mysite.com/moodle/course/format/grid/upgrade/convert_legacy_image.php?logverbose=1&amp;crop=1">http://www.mysite.com/moodle/course/format/grid/upgrade/convert_legacy_image.php?logverbose=1&amp;crop=1</a>
But keep in mind that with lots of records in the 'files' table this can cause the script to fail.</li>
<li>Observe the output of the script which is also replicated in the PHP log file.</li>
<li>Go back to the grid format course and confirm that the images are there.  It is possible that some old legacy files remain from
old images that were replaced.  At the present moment in time I have no way of detecting them (to be certain that they are
from the Grid format) in code.</li>
<li>I'm not sure of the security vulnerabilities of the script on the server so after you have used it and are confident of the
results then move it from the '/course/format/grid/upgrade/' folder to a safe non-served folder.</li>
</ol>

<h1>
<a id="downgrading" class="anchor" href="#downgrading" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Downgrading</h1>

<p>If for any reason you need to downgrade to a previous version of the format then the procedure will inform you how to
do so:</p>

<ol>
<li> Put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the administrator.</li>
<li> In '/course/format/' remove the folder 'grid' i.e. ALL it's contents - this is VITAL.</li>
<li> Put in the replacement 'grid' folder into '/course/format/'.</li>
<li> This step depends on if you are downgrading to a version prior to 15th July 2012, this should therefore only be for
Moodle 2.3.x and below versions.  If you are, perform step 4.1 otherwise, perform step 4.2.
4.1 In the database, remove the row with the 'plugin' of 'format_grid' and 'name' of 'version' in the 'config_plugins' table
and drop the 'format_grid_icon' and 'format_grid_summary' tables.  If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by
lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches' under 'Home -&gt; Site administration -&gt; Development -&gt;
Purge all caches'.
4.2 In the database, change the row with the 'plugin' of 'format_grid' and 'name' of 'version' in the 'config_plugins' table
to have the same 'value' as '$plugin-&gt;version' in the 'grid/version.php' file i.e. like '2013083000'.  Then perform a manual
'Purge all caches' under 'Home -&gt; Site administration -&gt; Development -&gt; Purge all caches'.</li>
<li> Go back in as an administrator and follow standard the 'plugin' update notification.  If needed, go to
'Site administration' -&gt; 'Notifications' if this does not happen.</li>
<li> Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.</li>
</ol>

<a id="reporting-issues" class="anchor" href="#reporting-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reporting Issues</h1>

<p>Before reporting an issue, please ensure that you are running the latest version for your release of Moodle.  Major version numbers
are always the same, so for Moodle 2.5.x there will be a Grid format 2.5.x.  The primary release area is located on
<a href="https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=format_grid">https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=format_grid</a>.  It is also essential that you are operating the required version of Moodle
as stated at the top - this is because the format relies on core functionality that is out of its control.</p>

<p>All 'Grid format' does is integrate with the course page and control it's layout, therefore what may appear to be an issue
with the format is in fact to do with a theme or core component.  Please be confident that it is an issue with 'Grid format'
but if in doubt, ask.</p>

<p>I operate a policy that I will fix all genuine issues for free (this only applies to the code as supplied from the sources listed
in 'Free Software' above.  Any changes / improvements you make are not covered and invalidate this policy for all of the code).
Improvements are at our discretion.  I am happy to make bespoke customisations / improvements for a negotiated fee.  I will
endeavour to respond to all requests for support as quickly as possible, if you require a faster service then offering payment for
the service will expedite the response.</p>

<p>It takes time and effort to maintain the format, therefore donations are appreciated.</p>

<p>When reporting an issue you can post in the course format's forum on Moodle.org (currently 'moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=47'), 
on Moodle tracker 'tracker.moodle.org' ensuring that you chose the 'Non-core contributed modules' and 'Course Format: Grid'
for the component or contact us direct (details at the bottom).</p>

<p>It is essential that you provide as much information as possible, the critical information being the contents of the format's 
version.php file.  Other version information such as specific Moodle version, theme name and version also helps.  A screen shot
can be really useful in visualising the issue along with any files you consider to be relevant.</p>

<h1>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h1>

<h2>
<a id="viewing" class="anchor" href="#viewing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Viewing</h2>

<p>Click on a grid icon or use 'esc' to open the current selected icon which will then display the shade box containing the section
content.  Click on the 'X' or use 'esc' to close.</p>

<p>Use the 'left' / 'right' cursor keys to select the previous / next section when the shade box is and is not displayed.</p>

<p>Use the 'left' / 'right' arrows that appear when hovering over the middle of the border when the shade box is shown to navigate to
the previous / next section.</p>

<p>When the 'Course layout' course setting are set to 'Show all sections on one page' the shade box will operate.  When set to
'Show one section per page' the shade box will not show but instead the icons will act like links as they do with the
'Topics' format and take you to a single section page.</p>

<h2>
<a id="editing" class="anchor" href="#editing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Editing</h2>

<p>Use the 'Change image' link underneath each icon to change the icon's image.</p>

<p>Edit the sections underneath the icons in the normal way.  Note: Some things like current section colour will not update until page
refresh.</p>

<p>The shade box is not shown in this mode.</p>

<a id="changing-the-keyboard-control-code" class="anchor" href="#changing-the-keyboard-control-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changing the keyboard control code</h2>

<p>To change the 'gridkeys.js' code then you'll firstly need to read: <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/dev/YUI/Shifter">http://docs.moodle.org/dev/YUI/Shifter</a>
it is used to build the source in '/yui/src/gridkeys/js/gridkeys.js' and bring in the 'gallery-event-nav-keys' to build
the YUI module into 'yui/build/moodle-format_grid-gridkeys' and place a back port minified version in '/yui/gridkeys' for
use in Moodle 2.3 and 2.4 versions - so even if you have those versions you will need this Moodle 2.5 version to
make changes.  The compiled YUI module is then loaded in all versions (2.3, 2.4 and 2.5) in 'renderer.php' by the line:
$PAGE-&gt;requires-&gt;yui_module('moodle-format_grid-gridkeys', 'M.format_grid.gridkeys.init', null, null, true);
So even though the location is different for M2.3 / M2.4 than M2.5 it's the same - that's a M2.5+ thing.  There is no
rocket science to using / learning Shifter, I did so late on a Saturday night whilst half asleep - admittedly with Andrew's
on-line assistance.</p>

<a id="current-selected-colour" class="anchor" href="#current-selected-colour" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current selected colour</h2>

<p>Edit 'styles.css', change the value in the '.course-content ul.gridicons li.currentselected' selector and perform a 'Purge all caches'
or override in your theme.</p>

<p>The grid/lang folder contains the language files for the format.</p>

<p>Note that existing formats store their language strings in the main
moodle.php, which you can also do, but this separate file is recommended
for contributed formats.</p>

<p>Of course you can have other folders as well as English etc. if you want to
provide multiple languages.</p>

<h2>
<a id="styles" class="anchor" href="#styles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Styles</h2>

<p>The file grid/styles.css contains the CSS styles for the format which can
be overridden by the theme.</p>

<h2>
<a id="backup" class="anchor" href="#backup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Backup</h2>

<p>The files:</p>

grid/backup/moodle2/restore_format_grid_plugin.class.php</p>

<p>are responsible for backup and restore.</p>

<p>Backup and restore run automatically when backing up the course.
You can't back up the course format data independently.</p>

<p>28th March 2014 Version 2.6.1.5
Change by G J Barnard</p>

<ol>
<li> Fix to RTL CSS thanks to Nadav Kavalerchik - <a href="https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-courseformat_grid/pull/3">https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-courseformat_grid/pull/3</a> being:
  Right align "New activity" notification image in RTL mode.</li>
<li> Fixed missing strings in 'en' language file for 'One section per page' mode.</li>
<li> Fixed number format on ordered lists as reported on <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=252497">https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=252497</a>.</li>
<li> Changed current selected image container to #ffc540 from #00cc00.  As the latter was too 'in your face'.</li>
<li> Added a new setting so that you can choose if you want to display the "New activity" notification image.  The default is yes.</li>
<li> Removed colour and font size attribute of icon text from styles.css.</li>
<li> Removed redundant icons.</li>
<li> Fixed box-sizing method for Bootstrap V3 in styles.css.</li>
<li> Slightly shrunk grid icon outside to make better use of available space.

<ol>
<li> Changed current section colour in the grid to use a box-shadow instead of a background to avoid confusion with
the current selected section.  This is a compromised as the latter is there for accessibility reasons and hence
rationally should stand out more.  This change will not be back-ported as it's not IE8 compatible,
<a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=box-shadow">http://caniuse.com/#search=box-shadow</a> and hence requires a version of Moodle that does not mandate it.</li>
<li> Fixed CONTRIB-4861 - Glossary pop-ups do not display correctly.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>18th December 2013 Version 2.6.1.4
Change by G J Barnard</p>

<ol>
<li> Fixed path and message confusion issue with the M1.9 upgrade script.</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed issue reported by Graham Woodsford whereby teachers could not create Collapsed Topics courses.  The code in the area
  concerned is identical to the Grid format and hence the same issue affects it too.  This is because the validation method
  'edit_form_validation' in 'lib.php' was failing the values passed to it.  These happened to be the hidden label values from
  'course_format_options' which were being used because the 'Course creator' role that teachers have before becoming an
  'editingteacher' role as defined in 'db/access.php' does not allow the teacher to have the
  'format/grid:changeimagecontainersize', 'format/grid:changeimageresizemethod' and 'format/grid:changeimagecontainerstyle'
  capabilities.  This also implies that the values of the other settings are wrong, which in fact they are, causing courses to
  be created (after fixing the colour settings for 'edit_form_validation') with odd values and not the defaults resulting in no
  icon set etc.  And therefore needing to go back to edit the course settings.</p>

<p>Ok, this now leads on to a dilemma.  Currently the course creator role does not have the Grid capabilities listed above.  If
  they were added to 'access.php' then the role would have them (existing Grid admins would have to add manually).  Then the
  teacher would see all the options when first creating a course as they do whilst editing.  However, this means that if you
  wish to restrict the teacher from changing things as is the purpose of the capabilities in the first place, then you have
  to remove the capability in both the 'coursecreator' and 'editingteacher' roles.  This is because by default 'coursecreator'
  is above 'editingteacher' and once enrolled on the course after having created it, the teacher has both.  This makes things
  a bit complex and to be honest not that admin friendly.  Therefore to keep things simple in what is in reality an event
  that is rare, I have decided not to add the capabilities to the 'coursecreator' role.  This is additionally based on the
  presumed work-flow of a teacher where they create the course using the defaults, look at it and then decide what to change
  in the settings.  The fix as it stands will facilitate this.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>13th December 2013 Version 2.6.1.3 - Zombie release.
Change by G J Barnard</p>

<ol>
<li> Fixed shade box still being shown in editing mode when update capability is denied.  Historical
  issue that has not been spotted before.  Given <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/Capabilities/moodle/course:update">http://docs.moodle.org/26/en/Capabilities/moodle/course:update</a>
  I have no idea why that specific capability was in the format for checking editing
  capability in conjunction with actual editing capability in the first place.  Fix
  is to remove the use of it completely which should marginally speed things up a bit.</li>
<li> Fixed sections disappearing when the icon is clicked on in editing mode.</li>
<li> Fixed icon image eventually disappearing when the section name / summary is changed.  See CONTRIB-4784, a
  big thank you to Nadav Kavalerchik for spotting what was the cause of this and thus providing a reliable
  means of replicating the issue.</li>
</ol>

<p>26th November 2013 Version 2.6.1.2
Change by G J Barnard</p>

<ol>
<li> Fix automated backups including displayed images when they should not.</li>
<li> Fix 'reset_grid_setting' in 'lib.php' not resetting a course if it's only on default options.</li>
<li> Fix restore using the wrong name for the 'image' field.</li>
<li> Only delete the old image file if it exists after the new one has been successfully
  created in 'setup_displayed_image' in 'lib.php'.</li>
<li> Fix course id set to default for courses created with versions prior to
  13/7/2012 causing an exception to be raised when a section's image record
  cannot be found and yet the record exists already.  This is due to new optimisation
  code relying on using 'courseid' to find the section records for the course in
  one go rather than getting them individually.</li>
<li> Ensure a course sets its settings when it is created and then detaches itself from the
  global defaults.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: I did find in changing the backup / restore code that the changes did not take hold until I
      restarted the web server (in my case the Apache service) if you encounter a situation where
      the automated backup files are larger than the manual ones, then please restart the web server
      service.</p>

<p>The mystery of the disappearing images as reported on: <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=244390">https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=244390</a>
by Dan Trockman and by Llywelyn Morgan where overnight the displayed images on old courses
disappear.  This could be caused by the fact that the backup mechanism intentionally removes the displayed
images so that they are not in the backup file which causes issues on restore.  Then the next time the
course is viewed they are automatically regenerated - this is intentional.  But, the automated
functionality calling the code within the format set the course id to '1' being the site course
and not to the course id of the course being backed up (point 1 above addresses this).  And hence
the displayed images for course 1 would be deleted by 'delete_images()', however this would not have
been an issue as there should be no records in the 'format_grid_icon' table for course id '1', but
because of '5' above, old courses had the 'course id' set to '1' and not the true course id of the
course.  And so the method 'delete_images()' deleted them.  This would have been fine as the regeneration
code should have put the images back, but because the code could not find the record containing the image
this did not happen (which '5' above fixes).  But what I cannot explain yet is why with Dan Trockman's
set up the 'database error' ('5') did not manifest itself.  But I hope that fixes '1' and '5' will repair
courses automatically when they are first viewed.  Currently I am unable to work exactly why this
is happening as have been unable to replicate it.  If you encounter the same problem, please let me
know with as much information as possible, like additional add-ons and when you notice it happening.</p>

<p>So, I have decided to release as is as the fixes above are important to distribute to the community.</p>

</ol>

<p>10th September 2013 Version 2.5.4 - Stable.
Change by G J Barnard</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Partial implementation of CONTRIB-3240.  Thanks to Andrew Nicols for helping with the YUI module code
  on: <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=237275">https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=237275</a>.
  This means that it is now possible to navigate using the keyboard with the 'left' / 'right' cursor keys
  being used to perform previous section / next section respectively and the 'esc' key to toggle open / closed
  the shade box.  As a bonus of this change I've added in navigation arrows to the shade box which appear when
  you hover over the middle of the sides - cool eh?
  Initially I also added Shift-TAB (previous section) / TAB (next section) / Enter (open shade box) /
  Shift-Enter (close shade box) keys to but after much deliberation (and logic issues) I have decided that until
  WIA-ARIA is fully understood I'll leave them out.  Once much more information is known I'll put them back in.
  Also thanks to Enrico Canale and Darren Britten of La Trobe University for their support and information.</p>

<p>Note:  If you're wondering where the M2.3 and M2.4 versions are, well I intend to release them a few days after
         this M2.5 version so that any bugs that have not been found can be fixed once without having to re-release
         three versions.</p>

<li> Added Pirate language.</li>
